# code_exp
DSTA BrainHack Code_exp Cat. 0 Team 67 Official GitHub Repository

Requirements:
1. Expo CLI https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/
2. NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/

Deployment Instructions:
1. Download Expo CLI and NodeJS (see above) into the local system, if not done so.
2. Open local command line interpreter and run the command: expo start my-app
3. Login with the pre-set login details (see below)

Pre-populated User Login Details:

User 1: 
  username: janesmith2022
  password: Dsta@2022

User 2: 
  username: ashishchugh2022
  password: Dsta@2022
  
User 3: 
  username: henrykhoo2022
  password: Dsta@2022

N.B. A copy of the full user JSON can be found in the first few lines of the source code. User data has also been pre-populated into firebase

Breakdown of Application Functions
1. User authentication mechanism (username and password validation)
2. Registration mechanism (incomplete due to government security reasons)
3. Notifications mechanism (pre-populated data only)
4. Forums (pre-populated data only)
5. Chats (pre-populated data only)
6. Profile (pre-populated data only)

Due to time constraints, we are unable to fully integrate the application with firebase. Instead, we have pre-populated the application with a set of data (in JSON format as provided in the file 'App.js') for demonstration purposes.
